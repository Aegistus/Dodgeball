All sounds are freely downloaded from Pixabay at https://pixabay.com/ - No specific website for each sound, they are all one-button downloadable on the list.

These sounds are candidates of each category, so we'll discuss to choose or add other sound source if needed. Please let me know if I missed any category like UI, menu-selecting, game losing, or etc.
I understand the game theme but I'm not sure if it's appropriate with 8-bit sounds or Groovy musics I chose.

Some are containing multiple sound effects - I can cut it out the part we need.
'Ouch' sound when the ball hit would be according to when you couldn't dodge the wrench. But generally it's good to use ball explosion.

Further we'll soon wrap this up, so let me know any sound updates needed. If we chose/revise them all correctly, I'll start put those in the project.
